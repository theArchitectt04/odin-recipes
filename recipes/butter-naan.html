        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups maida / all-purpose flour / refined flour / plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li> 1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup curd / yogurt (fresh thick)</li>
            <li>2 tsp oil</li>
            <li>lukewater as required (to knead)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp coriander leaves (finely chopped)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>firstly, in a large mixing bowl take maida, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, curd and oil. mix well making sure everything is combined well. further add lukewarm water and knead the dough for 10 minutes. cover with a moist cloth and rest for 2 hours in warm place.

            </li>
            <li>
                after 2 hours, knead the dough slightly. to remove if any air present in the dough. pinch a ball sized dough.gently roll to oval shape using rolling pin. make sure you do not make too thin nor thick. and also keep the size in mind. it should not be larger than your tawa size. grease with water over naan. make sure you coat uniformly. this helps naan to stick on tawa.
            </li>
            <li>
                slowly flip over and put it on hot tawa. remember, be gentle and put the water coated side down to tawa. also do not use nonstick tawa. slightly press. this helps the naan to stick on to the tawa and when you flip the tawa upside down it will be intact. now after a minute, flip the tawa upside down and cook naan directly on flame till they turn golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                also brush with some butter mixed with coriander leaves. gently scrape the naan from bottom and remove. finally, serve butter naan hot with your favourite curry like mattar paneer.
